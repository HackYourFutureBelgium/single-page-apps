# Single Page Apps

> "A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages."

## Study Tips

- Don't rush, understand! Programming is hard.
  - The examples and exercises will still be there to study later.
  - It's better to fail tests slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass tests quickly and not understand why.
- Don't skip the examples! Understanding and experimenting with working code is a very effective way to learn programming.
- Practice [Pair Programming](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/collaborating/pair-programming): two people, one computer./

Not all assignments are created equal. These 3 emoji's will help you figure out how to spend your study time as effectively as possible.

- ü•ö `:egg:` - these assignments are required, they cover the base skills you'll need to move on.
- üê£ `:hatching_chick:` - do your best to start these exercises. you don't need to finish or master them (yet) but getting the main idea will be helpful in coming weeks
- üê• `:hatched_chick:` - Have you finished all the ü•ö's and started all the üê£'s? push yourself with these challenges!

## About the Projects

In the previous module you learned to decompose & plan projects, organize your code, and use HTML/CSS/JS to implement simple websites that process user input. That's nice but it misses the big picture.

Enter: **State**. This is a fancy programming term to talk about the data stored by your web pages. Nearly every app you use has state -> message histories, images, profile details, weather reports, ... you name it! Data is the core of any application. Just like you learned to write tests to describe your functions and show that they do what they should.

A good way to understand applications is to think of their _data_ and the _interactions_ a user can have with that data. You will explore the connection between state, UI and UX by learning to write **Components**. Components are functions that return parts of your UI by rendering _state_ into something the user can see and interact with.

In this module's projects you will want to focus on the data in your web page, how users can interact with it, how it changes over time, and how it is rendered to the UI.
